I am a master's student in physics at the University of Milan. I did a bachelor thesis in particle physics about primary vertex selection in pp collisions of Run3 with the LHC's ATLAS detector. I am interested in particle physics from a theoretical and computational approach. I am 22 years old, enjoy playing piano, theater, physics and doing all these things with friends.
